		<center><h1> Hobbies/Talent!</h1></center>
		<br><br>
		<p>My hobby is watching Korean Dramas. I do this whenever I have free time. I also like browsing my social media and search some funny videos or memes there. I also love buying items online, most especialy when there is a big sale. Other than these, it is also my hobby to edit pictures, or take pictures.</p> <br>
		<p>As for my talent, to be honest, I haven't found anything yet. I just know how to do things, but I am not great at anything. The only thing that people around me points out is that I have a pretty handwriting. Maybe, it can be consider as talent? Haha. Anyway, I am trying to learn some calligraphy skills whenever I have time or I am in the mood for it.</p>

	<div id="strength">
		<br><br><br>
		<center><h1>My Strength!</h1></center>
		<br>
		<p>My creativeness can also be considered as my strength. I love to search or do designs that are pleasing to my eyes, and I think, it will be very useful in my future career. I have a little knowledge about programming, and I am also dilligent in learning new things about programming.</p>
		<center><h1>My Weaknesses!</h1></center>
		<br>
		<p>One of my weaknesses is that I am easily distracted. Even the small things can distract me when I am in the middle of doing something. I also lack confidence that makes it hard for me to say some of my opinions to other people. Aside from these, I am also easily discourage when things don't go my way.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="career">
		<br><br><br>
		<center><h1>Career</h1></center>
		<br>
		<p>Despite my weaknesses, I still want to be sure about the path I am going to take in the future. As of the moment, I am thinking about being a Data Entry Operator or Encoder. But, I am also thinking about being a web developer if I can. Regardless, I still hope that I could get the career I want that is related to what I am taking in the present. So that my four years in this course will not be a waste.</p>
